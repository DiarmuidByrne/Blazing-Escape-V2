# Blazing-Escape-V2
Blazing Escape Cross Platform update

This is my project for Mobile Application Development. The project is an 
infinite runner game powered by the Unity games engine. The game
uses lighting-based physics to allow the player to navigate through a procedurally-generated world with
dynamic traps. The app contains a leaderboard using the Azure cloud service and is cross-platform for both desktop 
and Windows Phone 8 builds.
